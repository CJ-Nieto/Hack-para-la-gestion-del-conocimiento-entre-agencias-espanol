## Definition of the Knowledge Base
A knowledge base is an online library that contains information about products, services, departments, or specific topics. In the context of ITSM (Information Technology Service Management), it is essential to streamline processes, from problem-solving to training and support.

## Project management, processes, and resources
- Create and manage resources in Microsoft Azure.
- Use ETL/ELT techniques to obtain quality data.
- Normalize and optimize data stores.
- Implement automation APIs.
- Design, create, and implement data templates for collaborators to integrate and contribute to the knowledge base.
- Design and create files compatible with Microsoft Azure, enriched with large amounts of keywords.
- Implement monitoring and performance systems to maintain proper functioning, detect failures, and perform maintenance.
- Provide large petabytes of information at the user's disposal, constantly updated.
- Perform backups and maintain optimal backup areas to prevent data loss in case of a disaster.

## Azure services for Knowledge Management
- **Azure Cognitive Search**: To index and search content in the knowledge base.
- **Azure Blob Storage**: To store documents, images, and other files.
- **Azure SQL Database**: To store metadata.
- **Azure Logic Apps**: To automate workflows.
- **Azure Web Apps**: To deploy an accessible web application.

## Integration of unstructured data
Use Azure Cognitive Services to extract information from unstructured documents, transforming them into machine-readable formats and storing them appropriately.

## ETL/ELT
Create ETL/ELT workflows with Azure Data Factory or Azure Logic Apps to process and load data into the knowledge base.

## Data visualization
Use Power BI to create interactive dashboards and visualizations, providing an intuitive interface for users.

## Knowledge Mining in Azure
### What is Knowledge Mining?
Knowledge Mining is an AI discipline that combines intelligent services to extract information from large amounts of data.

### Phases of Knowledge Mining
- **Ingestion**: Import content from various sources.
- **Enrichment**: Use AI to extract information and discover patterns.
- **Exploration**: Access newly indexed data through search and visualizations.

## Azure AI Services
- **Azure AI Search**: To identify and explore relevant content.
- **Azure AI Services**: To apply cognitive capabilities to different types of content.
- **Azure Machine Learning**: To apply custom models.
- **Azure AI Bot Service**: To design interactive experiences using bots.

### Description
Interinstitutional collaboration is essential for effective governance, and knowledge management plays a crucial role in facilitating it. Today, government agencies make large amounts of data available to the public, enabling experts from all organizations to collaborate, share knowledge, and learn from each other. This project aims to use public datasets to promote joint research efforts, impact assessments, and programs, leading to solid evidence-based decision-making.

### Hack objective
To design, develop, and implement a richly enhanced knowledge base that operates optimally and efficiently through an online user interface. This platform will allow large organizations, collaborators, researchers, students, and businesses to integrate for inquiries, research, and collaborations, always maintaining innovation as a fundamental pillar.
